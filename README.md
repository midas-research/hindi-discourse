The Hindi Discourse Analysis dataset is a corpus for analyzing discourse modes present in its sentences. It contains sentences from stories written by 11 famous authors from the 20th Century. 4-5 stories by each author have been selected which were available in the public domain resulting in a collection of 53 stories. Most of these short stories were originally written in Hindi but some of them were written in other Indian languages and later translated to Hindi.

The corpus contains a total of 10472 sentences belonging to the following categories:
- Argumentative
- Descriptive
- Dialogic
- Informative
- Narrative
